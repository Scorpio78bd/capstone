    Welcome to my Capstone Project! I am excited to be able to exhibit my expanding knowledge of coding and web design. I am currently a student at the Array School of Technology and Design, with a projected completion date of April, 2019. I look forward to designing and running two of my own websites in the near future, where I will be presenting before and after photos of the houses I plan to renovate and stage for sale and another showcasing my exclusive line of apparel that will be avaiable for purchase in the Spring of 2019.
